This repository demonstrates a subtle but potentially problematic behavior of the `removeIf` function when applied to `MutableMap` in Kotlin.  The example shows how `removeIf` works with Lists and Sets, highlighting the difference in behavior with Maps which can lead to subtle and hard-to-detect bugs. Concurrent modification is a key issue,  making this a significant edge case that's easily overlooked. The solution explores safer and more predictable ways to modify maps based on conditions.
